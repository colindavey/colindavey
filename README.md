# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Greetings! I'm Colin Davey. You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinmdavey/), and my website at [colindavey.com](https://www.colindavey.com). 

The project I'm most excited about these days is my [chess monorepo](https://github.com/colindavey/chess-monorepo) for developing a family of web-based chess apps that share components. ([Game app live here](https://colindavey-chess-monorepo-game.netlify.app), [Setup app live here](https://colindavey-chess-monorepo-setup.netlify.app))

I'd also like to discuss the background to this project because it shows how I learn and solve problems. It began for the purpose of improving and displaying my React and Python skills. I chose chess software as the vehicle. 

It began as [py-chess-tree-two-week-challenge](https://github.com/colindavey/py-chess-tree-two-week-challenge) - a fully functional chess opening repertoire editor that I wrote in Python in two weeks in 2016, when I hadn't had any Python experience. It was a challenge I assigned to myself to force myself to learn Python fast, and to demonstrate that I could be effective in languages that were new to me. [py-chess-tree](https://github.com/colindavey/py-chess-tree) - is a recent continuation of the above, improving the GUI, and refactoring leading towards making a React.js version of the app.

I then began working on creating a web-based version using React in the following steps: 

[react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial) - the results of going through the official [React tutorial] (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Not much to see here. It's what you will get if you do the tutorial. 

[react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial-to-hooks](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial-to-hooks) - my refactoring of the above React tic-tac-toe tutorial, including translating it from a class-based app to a functional one using hooks. 

[react-tic-tac-toe-ndim](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-ndim) - in the process of warping the tic-tac-toe app into a chess app, I created this NxN tic-tac-toe app. ([See it live here](https://colindavey-ndim-tic-tac-toe.netlify.app)

[react-tic-tac-toe-to-chess](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-to-chess) - continuing from the NxN tic-tac-toe app above, this is a mostly fully functional chess app. Presents a GUI, lets you make moves, only allows legal moves, the GUI includes a listing, and you can click on any move to return to the position. This has been absorbed into the chess monorepo above. 

Cheers,
- C
