# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Please pardon the dust as I'm just beginning to prepare my GitHub profile for public consumption. I'm Colin Davey. You can find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinmdavey/), and my website at [colindavey.com](https://www.colindavey.com). 

What I'm most excited about these days are some projects I'm working on to improve and display my React and Python skills by developing some chess software. Related to this are:

[py-chess-tree-two-week-challenge](https://github.com/colindavey/py-chess-tree-two-week-challenge) - a fully functional chess opening repertoire editor that I wrote in Python in two weeks in 2016, when I hadn't had any Python experience. It was a challenge I assigned to myself to force myself to learn Python fast, and to demonstrate that I could be effective in languages that were new to me. 

[py-chess-tree](https://github.com/colindavey/py-chess-tree) - recent continuation of the above, refactoring leading towards making a React.js version of the app. 

[react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial) - the results of going through the official [React tutorial] (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Not much to see here. It's what you will get if you do the tutorial. 

[react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial-to-hooks](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-tutorial-to-hooks) - my refactoring of the above React tic-tac-toe tutorial, including translating it from a class-based app to a functional one using hooks. 

[react-tic-tac-toe-ndim](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-ndim) - in the process of warping the tic-tac-toe app into a chess app, I created this NxN tic-tac-toe app. Right now you set the dimensions (N) by editing a constant in the source code, but I would soon like to add a widget that lets you change the dimensions with the GUI. 

[react-tic-tac-toe-to-chess](https://github.com/colindavey/react-tic-tac-toe-to-chess) - continuing from the NxN tic-tac-toe app above, this is a mostly fully functional chess app. Presents a GUI, lets you make moves, only allows legal moves, the GUI includes a listing, and you can click on any move to return to the position. Needs special logic for when the game ends, and handling of pawn promotions. 

Upcoming, as soon as I can get to it while juggling numerous projects and life,
* more documentation
* images
* links to where the web apps are deployed so you can see them in action. 

Cheers,
- C
